## Author's Note

Hi, thanks for checking out Tosui. I'm Dan, the creator of this project, and I'd love to share what this project is, where it is right now, and where I hope to take it.

## About

First, what is it? Tosui is a UI framework and component library, similar to Chakra, MUI, or Ant Design. It aims to provide a solid set of core components, as well as a way to customize the look and feel of these components.

The difference between Tosui and other systems is that Tosui is deliberately trying to keep its customization surface small and simple. Learning how to theme Tosui should be grokkable. In my experience, customizing other systems often feels daunting and overly complex.

I hope to accomplish this by having a limilted number of style tokens and keeping themeing limited to CSS variables. I.e. you don't have to define 10 different shades for every color or learn a complex theming API to create a custom theme.

## Status

Currently, Tosui is in its "exploration" phase. I'm still trying to figure out the right component APIs are, what components should exist, and even how CSS should be handled (currently using Stylex, but considering moving to vanilla CSS).

## Goals

The primary goal is to have a React UI framework that's lightweight, themable, and has enough components to build the majority of most UIs.

Once that's done, I hope to port this to other frameworks, including React Native.
